#here we go to the tuples
#it is almost the same and the difference between there is this it is immutable xD (well it's not like me i guess)

frey = (12,43,75) #now the main difference is that you can't change it

frey[1]

#well what i see is tuple have too methods

tuple.index(frey)
tuple.count(frey)

#but we can't change the values

# NOw time for SET's 

s = {4,12,64,73}
# it will Never Follow the sequence 
#wanna see some intresting thing Here

s = {14,64,85,25,13,6}
# well, when you run this you will got 13 for one time, (it works on hash)

#change a value but it's not support indexing

# try by yourself by using pyhton docs 

s.add(1:24)
